These are some simple CNFs for grading aspects of the student's
solutions

unification-1.cnf -- test that only one C# constant is unified at a time.
unification-2.cnf -- test that you can't unify a constant with a
                     function.
unification-3.cnf -- substitute x with A twice.
unification-4.cnf -- fails because x is substituted with two differing
                     constants.
unification-5.cnf -- multiple variables subed with the same constant.
ans-lit-1.cnf -- a simple test with the answer literal.
ans-lit-2.cnf -- a simple test with the answer literal and
                 multi-variables.
occurs-check.cnf -- test that the occurs check is implemented correctly.
nested-funcs.cnf -- test nested functions.
