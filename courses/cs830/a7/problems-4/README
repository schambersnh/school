 wffs - A directory containing problems stated in first order logic.
      	You can convert these to CNF using wffs-to-cnf.

 cnf -  A directory under which there are two additional directories
     	containing problems in conjunctive normal form.

 cnf/simple - Has some simple problems which test for specific
 	      operations your theorem prover will need to perform.
 	      What they're testing for is explained in the INDEX file
	      in this directory

 cnf/complex - Some more difficult CNF problems.  These are more
 	       representative of the problems we'll actually be
 	       testing your theorem prover against.
