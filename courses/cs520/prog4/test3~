 Given the way he has swung the bat this spring, Ramirez's recovery from offseason shoulder surgery isn't even a concern for Fantasy owners at this point, and though he hit only .243 with a .712 OPS before going down with the shoulder injury last season, his back was less than 100 percent at that point. “It’s about core,” Perez said. “Your back, it affects your legs, and you’re not comfortable. He’s healthy now. At the beginning, everybody was talking about the shoulder, and it’s not. He’s strong there. But now, he’s strong with his back.” At this time a year ago, Ramirez was considered a five-category stud and a candidate to go first overall in Fantasy. Considering he's still eligible at shortstop, he has the potential to be quite the bargain with a second-round pick this year.
