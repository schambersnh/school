This is a simple file that contains some names in Lastname, Firstname order
along with other things as well as Smith, John.

There is nothing to prevent Jones, Linda from finding Anderson, Frank before
the meeting started.

How about a name that crosses line boundaries as in Masters,  
John. Depending on the task specification, this may or may not be found.

Of course, this approach is far from stable, since it would swap addresses
also, such as Durham, New Hampshire.
